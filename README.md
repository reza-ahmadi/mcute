# Welcome

This website includes the followings:

* A Model-level Concolic Unit Testing Engine (mCUTE): its source code
* A set of UML-RT Models
* Video tutorials on how to use mCUTE

 
## How to run mCUTE:

**1st approach** (easy and suitable to treat mCUTE as a black box): 

1. Download our virtual machine that includes everything to run mCUTE, including mCUTE drivers and Papyrus-RT. Download the VM from here: 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DIjLxFqPLQUuLrRtR_QecJUOLlhGSAqt/view?usp=sharing
2. Use VirtualBox to import the image
3. On the image, there is a Papyrus-RT with mCUTE as a plugin on it. There are some sample models on the Desktop as well (as well as on the mCUTE source code which you can download in this site)

**2nd approach** (harder and suitable for when you want to know more about how mCUTE works and possibly extend it):

1. Get Papyrus-RT by following the instructions here: [https://www.eclipse.org/papyrus-rt/](Link URL)
2. Download our source code from the repository.
3. Build the source code and run mCUTE.


## Some video tutorials on how to use mCUTE (mCUTE runs in command prompt and now in Eclipse):
